"[""If you've already used or owned an S8, the S9 is going to be a very familiar device.  Same-fish design, same glorious Samoled display, same 18.5:9 aspect ratio, etc. Dont expect a drastic change from the S8 going to this phone."", ""However, there are improvements such as a dual aperture camera, which isn't an apparent change at first until you dive into pro mode, a stereo speaker setup with the earpiece finally playing media when watching videos or playing games, and a better fingerprint sensor location. The bottom chin of the phone is also a bit smaller than it is on the S8 so there's a little asymmetricism going on when you rotate the phone sideways but hey, no dumb notch right? Samsung's skin is still drastically different from Google's vision of Android but serious work done with the s8 to improve performance is still present and I actually prefer the aesthetics of Samsung Experience, the new name of the software skin compared to stock vanilla android Oreo."", ""Only downsides I can see are still average battery life and the general use of gorilla glass 5, which is more shatter resistant but quite a bit easier to scratch. There's two or three microscratches along the front glass though it's just the oleophobic coating and it's nowhere near the sensors, not to mention it's hard to see. That might just be me though as I'm rockin' the phone naked. Curved glass is also pretty much just for aesthetics and having an option to not have them or at least just have small curved edges would be more preferable but not a big issue for me."", ""Either way, the S9 is a definite option to consider if you're planning to upgrade to a new phone anytime soon.""]"
"['Love the phone it just can get scratched easily but you can just put a case on it. This phone is for you!!']"
"[""I got this phone last month to replace my old iPhone, as I was tired of Apple for a variety of reasons. I was impressed with the picture quality and, reading the reviews, I convinced myself to switch to the Gallaxy S9. When I first received it, I loved it - and this would be a very different review if I wrote it then. But I live in Europe and soon the problems started to show. No Samsung Pay - at all. I checked everywhere and no one has an answer on how to fix that. Then the camera started freezing. It wouldn't go from selfie to portrait nor from camera to gallery without needing a restart. I now just left Samsung's flagship shop in London to find out what to do. Turns out my ONLY choice is to send it back to America and hope for the best. So if you live abroad, know certain features on your phone just will not work and if you ever need assistance, you flat out won't get it.""]"

"['The Samsung Galaxy S9 is probably the most amazing phone I have bought to date.  The camera has great features, so if you use the camera function on your cell phone a lot, this is the phone for you!', 'The wireless charge function is probably the best part of this phone.  My last phone had the charging port go bad after 5 years of use (I loved the phone so much I used it until I just could not eek out another charge).  Not having to stick in a plug every day should make this a non issue for this S9.', 'I could write an extensive technical review, but there are lots of those.  SO Ill stick with these two most practical features for the every day phone users!']"
"[""Definitely the best smartphone I've used in a while""]"
"['The phone was great but the screen seems to be very fragile in my case the phone screen cracked while being in my pocket and protected by tempered glass and a phone case after thus i called my insurance and they sent me back a new phone for a deductible of $200 the new phone broke in the same way as the first one although this one was not protected by tempered glass']"
"[""This, most definitely is the best smartphone you can get today. It's so beautiful. I fall in love with it every single day. Add the wireless charger, ear buds, and watch, and you've got yourself an amazing smartphone experience."", ""You do need to get a cover for the glass back though, because it's not as strong as it is proposed to be. Get the Alcantara case from Samsung. Also, stick with apps from the play store, and themes from Samsung ‚Ñ¢, you'll have a hitch free, glitch free ride..""]"

"['Love it and hope they replace mine withOUT DEADSPOTS AND ISSUES WITH WARRANTY AND RECOMMENDED INSURANCE.']"
"[""I've worked in the wireless industry since the very beginning of iPhone & Android. I've been hands on with every smartphone from the HTC EVO 4G (one of the first 'big' screen phones sitting at a whopping 4.3in), Samsung Galaxy Fascinate (the first Galaxy phone of it's kind) Blackberry Curve, Bold, Torch and of course, iPhone. The first smartphone I owned was the Blackberry Curve following the discontinuation of the trackball (on the curve, the Bold still had it). From the Blackberry, I switched back and forth between Apple and Android for years, but always ended up sticking with Apple simply because the OS was more stable, the screen's response time was less laggy and as we all know, more accessories."", ""Well last week, I had the iPhone 7 and for the past couple of months became more and more disappointed with apps force closing, losing service (more of a Sprint issue), alarms not going off, videos not loading when I did have serivce, battery dying by the middle of the day after a full night's charge, I was done. Looking at my options, the iPhone 8 seems like the poor man's iPhone X or for those who did not have the 7. The iPhone X itself is just WAY too expensive for me to sign for. Then we have the latest flagship Android devices, the Samsung s9 and the Google Pixel 2."", ""Now to be honest, if I decided to switch to Verizon instead of At&t, I probably would have gone with the Pixel 2 (exclusive to verizon) but I've always preferred At&t. I decided to bite the bullet one more time and strp away from Apple, so I went with the s9. Now keep in mind, I use a s7 for work and I absolutely hate that phone, so that alone had me second guessing my decision. The main reason I did it was due to the price difference. Until I have no choice, I'll never spend over 4 digits on a phone."", ""For the first time ever, I can confidently say that I will never go back to an iPhone, Samsung finally got it right. This phone has succeeded every expectation I had. The most important enhancement from previous models is the screen's response time, without a doubt. The ease of using the keyboard on an iPhone vs Android has always been a winning factor to me, but that is no longer the case. The touchscreen I'd so fluit, the processor is rapid fast and does not hesitate for a second while bouncing between applications, the camera is AMAZING and even has it's own version of Apple's portrait mode, except Samsung gives you the ability to adjust focus even after the picture has been taken. Up to 400gb expandable storage on a phone that's $300 cheaper than it's competition, are you kidding me??"", ""I also preferred the iPhone due to it's simplicity and over-the-top customization never appealed to me. But wow, has Samsung come a long way since I last played with their themes. It's so much cleaner and user friendly. After convincing myself I'd probably just keep the phone stock, I ended up pulling an all-nighter going through all the personalization options until I finally designed me phone to feel 100% unique for me. Best of all, aside from the addition of Google Keyboard, I did not use any 3rd party apps, everything was done through Samsung Themes which keeps it just as stable as the stock version of the phone. Oh and the screen itself? Absolutely beautiful. 4k video and images are breathtaking and the curve has finally been perfected. Battery life? After 10 hours, I'm 79% as of this very minute. Fast charging could put me back up to 100% easily within 15-20 minutes."", ""If Samsung continues improving from the s9, I will never switch back to any other phone. Even if they end up blowing it down the road, I'll be looking towards the Google Pixel (unlocked in my case) either way, no more Apple. It's simply not worth it compared to the quality available elsewhere and Samsung has finally proven that to me.""]"
"[""Light years better than any Apple iPhone product; so much more freedom and REAL user-friendly experience...it looks/acts like an actual computer. I can access any/all files, doesn't need any proprietary software...no hassles at all. The sound is really impressive with Samsung Music & Dolby ATMOS too. USB-C charging is amazingly fast, expandable storage via MicroSDXC and the world's most amazing camera."", 'the pricetag is a whopper at >$700 for 64GB storage, but it is Android 8.0 (Oreo)...soon to upgrade to Android P.']"
"['fantastic phone but the screen scratches so easily. must get a screen protector. the white dome worked perfect and hid all the scratches.']"
['Good']
"['One of the best smartphones!']"
"[""DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!!! Samsung S9 has a useless battery. I can literally see the battery life decreasing right before my eyes. It doesn't last a full 8-5 normal use. That's without any use of videos and Spotify. The phone is fast, amazingly fast. But not worth the money. Def, not worth it."", ""A phone must be able to go through a day without running out of battery. And that's cos I disabled important features, like face and iris recognition."", ""Terrible. If I were you, i'd stay away from it.""]"

"['Very nice cell phone!']"
"['The Galaxy S8 Plus battery was great, this feels like a major step backward, as I needed to charge the phone at least 3 times just to get through 8-5.', 'There are also major software problems too: the VPN simply refused to function after switched from Wi-Fi to cellular, requiring manual disconnect and reconnect to the VPN. My office has several Wi-Fi dead spots, as you can see it can get frustrating very quickly. Samsung support is virtually useless, they kept on saying it is not a problem.', ""Now the good: camera is phenomenal, the best out there; performance is light years ahead of the S8, I don't even see the stuttering in the Google Play Store, that's how smooth the phone is."", 'Overall, solid phone hindered by poor battery life and my personal issue with VPN according to Samsung, so I decided to deal with it as a customer who has an issue with the product: returning it. Guess I would use the S8 one more year.']"
"['Clearly I am not a Samsung fanboy. I purchased an S6 that I was unhappy with. The amount of ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software was incredible. The phone\'s performance was at best lackluster. I traded it in after a few months. Then the S9 came out with much fanfare and reviews that often put ahead of anything else. It\'s as bad or worse than the S6. Yes performance is way ahead, but the ""bloatware"" and ""pushed"" software is worse than ever.The touch screen seems ultra sensitive at the edge, but try touching in the middle. It\'s hit or miss, even with the sensitivity set to believe I have a screen protector which I don\'t. Opening the screen sometimes reveals the home page, sometimes it is some other random thing from an app. Then there\'s ""butt dials"" that I\'m not sure are truly butt dials as I have had more in 3 months than I have had in in total over the last 3 years! While on that subject, I an be walking around with my phone in my pocket and it suddenly starts playing music. The local Verizon store has attempted to resolve many of these issues without success. They have offered to replace the phone, but the one that they sent me was ""refurbished"" and had many scratches on the screen-light but still scratches. I refused it. All this makes me wonder how the reviews could be so positive. Farewell Samsung.']"
"['excellent...arrived on time and brand new. everything functions as it should']"
"[""Back in March, I switched from an LG V20 to the S9+ because the screen on my LG began to bleed through. Big mistake. The Samsung pales in comparison to the LG. There's no tap or knock to wake option, the fingerprint sensor is finicky, scrolling through social media is a chore and I found myself growing more and more aggravated with daily use. In short, I paid the phone off early. When I was in the store explaining at how dissatisfied I was with the phone, a Samsung representative was present.  Upon overhearing my gripes, he just said something about not pleasing everyone. While that's true and there is no perfect phone, Samsung sure has some catching up to do with LG.  Much better User Interface on LG and the fingerprint sensor isn't as finicky.  Do yourself a favor and check out the V30 or the G7.  Skip the S9+""]"

I also like the fact you could turn off the call connected/disconnected tones.', ""The phone also has some other things I just can't live with.

"[""I am a die hard Apple person. All my desktop computers at home are Apple, my other 4 family members all have iPhones and we have laptops that are all Apple. Not really sure why I decided to try out the Samsung Galaxy S9+ but happy that I did so far. I was using a 4 1/2 year old iPhone 5s so I figured any phone would be a huge upgrade to the modern world. It still takes a little getting used to coming from the IOS system's way of doing things. I do lose the capability of iMessage and FaceTime. Not a huge deal and I can use the DUO app from Google which is the same as FaceTime. The key points with this phone are that the large and beautiful screen looks great. I like the haptic feel of the keys when texting how you feel the keys being pressed (a little buzz/vibration). I think the new iPhone X does this too but again, I'm coming from a 5s. My only two choices for a new phone were this S9+ or keep on with Apple and get an iPhone X. The X would have cost me $1150 plus an AppleCare warranty for $200. I got this Samsung (and got the Ultimate Play Bundle) for $840 plus $100 for the bundle. Took out a Square Trade 2 year warranty for $108 with only a $99 deductible should I need to use it. I have used Square Trade warranties in the past for other products and they have always replaced and stood by their guarantee. Square Trade is owned by Allstate so I have confidence in them. Getting back to the phone, the S9+ seems to work VERY fast when loading apps and pages. I use it for a lot of my wireless products at home (Nest thermostat, wireless cameras, LIFX lights, Liftmaster garage door opener) and all work fast and flawlessly. The audio when playing music sounds great. Plays very loud and clear for a phone. I like the fact that it does still have an earphone jack. I like the Android system as it comes with Google Assistant voice command. Most people hate the Bixby feature on this phone. My only real gripe with it is the large button on the left side of the phone and that when trying to adjust the phone volume I accidentally hit Bixby sometimes. I do like though that i's voice activated. I get in my car in the morning, speak to wake up Bixby and command it to open up whatever app I need (usually Waze). Once open, I speak to Waze to take me to work. All of this without having to look at my phones screen or take my eyes off the road. Also, the Bixby AI camera function is very cool too. There are about 8 or 9 different things it can do with the camera. Like, point the camera lens at a sign in a foreign language and have it live translate the sign to English or any other language on the phone (and there are plenty of them on this phone). Point it at food and it will tell you what it is and average calorie count. Point it at a wine bottle label and it will give you the information on the wine (type, year, etc...). The ONLY thing I think I will never use again and of course I tried it out is the Animoji of myself or any of my friends. It's scary weird. Everyone looks the same on this. I would personally like to see an update to the phone where they fix this to be more of a 3D type and look more realistic. I have been looking online for days at comparisons of the pictures taken on this phone compared to others. Mot notably the iPhone X. In my opinion, the X does do a lot of pix better. The contrast is usually better. The real advantage to this phone is it tends to overexpose a bit. So, dark scenes will look a bit brighter than on the iPhone X. The only thing I had to get used to is the colors on a Samsung phone are very oversaturated. Colors are very bright. There is a setting in display function that gives you 4 options of view. I turned it down to one of them and it now looks a LOT more realistic. I like the fact that this phone, as well as the iPhone X, features ability to record video at 4K 60fps. Looks great. On the Samsung though the optical stabilization doesn't work when shooting 4K 60fps. Keep a steady hand and this isn't an issue. For all other video formats, the stabilization on the Samsung works better than the X. All in all, I am happy I went with the Samsung. In a few months if I regret it, I can always keep it for a few months and sell it to get the new larger iPhone X Plus."", ""UPDATE: 4/7/2018.  The voice unlock code is terrible. And, after searching through the options on the phone I came to the conclusion I don't need it. I have the face unlock or the fingerprint reader on the back. I actually go to the back fingerprint scan to unlock more than the other methods as it's just quick and easy to use. Battery life has been good so far after using this phone for 3 weeks now. One thing I find annoying that I didn't know would be a problem is the video and picture quality when someone sends me a large video via texting. Whether I send them a video or they send me one, it becomes such low quality that it's almost hard to see it at all. This is because of the compression the carriers use to send these video's or large picture files so it doesn't take up much space. I was used to having an iPhone and using iMessage. Send any size video to someone else with an iPhone and it was in great quality on both sides of the text. Not so with Android. Now this is not just Samsung but all Android phones. So, for now, I have to send videos via WhatsApp or Viber (or a number of other text apps). They do compress but not horribly. Oh, and one more note. I hope Samsung corp is reading this review. The Samsung customer service reps have to be the stupidest people I have ever dealt with for a tech company. I used to think Comcast was bad until I called a couple of times and had to speak with someone at Samsung. They just repeat my question and tell me they understand how I feel offering absolutely no answers. They put you on hold to find out but come back with no resolve. Just terrible customer service. 180 degrees from dealing with someone at AppleCare when I had a question about my iPhone or iMac computer."", ""2nd UPDATE: I didn't  realize this and this is VERY important to know before purchasing. In fact, I'm on the AT&T network with my phone and the people in the factory store didn't know this. The sales people in Best Buy in the phone department did not know this either. When you buy an unlocked Galaxy S9 or S9+, your phone is $840. If however you want to buy it thru AT&T for their network and not a factory unlocked phone, it has different options on it. Meaning, the unlocked phone WILL NOT have: WIFI calling option, HD Audio option, VVM (video voice messaging) and you will not get video voice calling. The option for these features is not even on my phone. Now, you CAN buy the AT&T phone and pay $915 up front or on a plan (either way it's $75 more than the factory unlocked phone). After you pay $75 ,more and if you are paying the full price up front, you can get the AT&T phone unlocked and then you will have these features. Nowhere at Best Buy or any AT&T store do they tell you this. In my mind, it's a great misrepresentation that is omitted when purchasing. I picked up the bundle package here on Amazon for $100 more and got a lot of cool gadgets so I'm keeping my setup. I just want others to know there is a difference when buying the unlocked version both in price and the feature set you get. I figured the AT&T version just had a bunch of their proprietary apps pre-installed. Hope this helps out someone beforehand that really wants those features. And, I went to the AT&T store figuring there was a way they could flash the options to my phone. There isn't. They cannot update your phone to get these options."", '3rd UPDATE: April 15th, 2018', ""I discovered a great feature today. I wish these Galaxy 9 phones had the rise to wake feature which is what the iPhone X has. You pick up the phone and just look at it to unlock via your face and it's good to go. What I discovered is setting the Google Assistant to open the Galaxy EVEN FROM the locked screen via my voice and the phone unlocks and does what you ask the Google Assistant to do. Love this feature immensely."", '4th UPDATE April 23, 2018', ""As I play around more with this phone, I am learning some cool things it can do. For instance, from the factory it come pre-set so that whether you swipe up or down the phone will go to your app tray. No need for repetition with swiping either up or down. There is a setting so that when you swipe up it opens the app tray (as it come from Samsung pre-set) but change the setting and when you swipe down from any place on the phone and you've got your phones popular settings in front of you. Even better, if you swipe down using two fingers from the top of the screen, it opens the second part of the settings which control other functions (usually this is a two part deal so this makes it one step easier). Also, one thing Samsung addressed with the 9 and 9+ (using the Oreo software) is a problem people using these phones prior used to hate. Now, you can set the up/down volume buttons to control MEDIA volume no matter what you are viewing. And, if you want to control the ringtone or another type of volume, when you push up or down on the volume and the MEDIA volume shows just tap on the down arrow on the top left of the screen and you have all the others ready to adjust exactly as you like them. Apparently from reading online this has been an annoyance of a problem for a long time with the Galaxy phones that is now solved.""]"

Aren't I the lucky one?  I think I'm still lucky in other ways - it's hit and miss whether you get a functioning phone.  New phone arriving tomorrow and will go to Verizon store for set up as I did with this phone.  Wish me luck please!  Thanks.""]"

I've been a loyal Samsung customer for years, and when I hold a phone for long term use I really keep it until something is worth purchasing. Where the iPhone lacks the S9 Plus makes up for. The Ram, expandable storage option of 400 GB's, and beautiful display, & somewhat ok price(the more advance the more expensive technology will be) places the phone already ahead of many phone companies. Samsung truly improved upon the phone, and I can say I'm satisfied.""]"

"[""Like the title says... I was using an iPhone 5c which was incredibly slow thanks to apple purposefully making it damn near impossible to use after the last and final update they sent me about a year ago.  I'll break down what I like and do not like about this phone though:"", ""Pros - slim, shiny, beautiful screen, fast response times from everything to opening the phone to the apps I use as well as the internet.  If has built in facial and iris recognition and allows you have the alternative option of putting a code or password into the phone to open it.  (Honestly I highly recommend choosing a backup option to unlock the phone because although the facial and iris recognition is great, it's not flawless especially if you're wearing a costume, heavy makeup, etc.) The sound is great and the quality of the photos is amazing compared to what I had before."", ""Cons: the phone is much heavier than what I am used to or what I had expected.  The camera, although great when you're far away, has absolutely awful quality (much worse than my old iPhone) when you zoom in.  The price for the phone was about average.  I found this to be a better deal than the Google XL 2, or the iPhone X which in my opinion were both overpriced, however I still think 760 with taxes is a little much for a phone, especially one that didn't introduce anything new to the market that wasn't already out there and available with other products and companies.  Lastly, if you are an iOS user and are considering switching to android like I did, heed my warning, because I can't put this in larger letters if I tried: DO NOT FORGET TO DEACTIVATE YOUR IMESSAGES.  if you do not deactivate them, you will NOT be able to receive imessages (texts) from ANY iPhone or iPad user.  I ran into a huge issue with this and even though I was incredibly careful, I STILL had to visit the apple webpage to manually deactivate my apple account in order to fix the issue."", 'All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.', ""P.S.: note that if you are changing from iOS to android, you may also run into a problem transferring apps and logging back into any cross phone / platform games that you were playing.  I had to find work around and contact account recovery due to apple using game center vs. Android using Google and Facebook.  I highly suggest you link any games you can't live without to Facebook or gmail prior to switching devices or you will find yourself switching back and forth between devices several times to resolve the issue.""]"

Swipe up and right and you pretty much have all your emails and text brought up. Swipe up and left opens the menu. Double pressing volume up and down skips a song and battery is swappable so you don't have to worry about it. Unfortunately blackberry now produce junkfood. Should you be interested, just google blackberry z10 virtual keyboard and tell me how nifty is that. "", "" \r\nAs for the S7, the battery simply won't last for a day. It comes bloated with S home, Sgear, S-every where. Regardless if my mother makes a good application, samsung thinks they can make it better. In the end? All the propiotary apps are unable to be removed. An update later will more than likely re-enable them. Samsung-pay beggs you throughout your week to try it and while Samsung finally found out that they needed more cpu power, they just upgrade the main-chip and call it a S8. "", "" \r\nSimply said, I currently have a Sony Xperia xz1 Compact. Clean android performance with a snapdragon 835.
